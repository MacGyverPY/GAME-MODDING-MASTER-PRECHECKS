=============================================

**Author:** [MAC]
**Version:** 6.0 ‚Äì Stable Release (Public)  
**Release Date:** October 2025  
**Script Type:** PowerShell  
**Compatibility:** Windows 10 / 11 (Pro & Enterprise editions)  
**Purpose:** Perform deep system and security diagnostics before launching or testing game modifications.

üß† Overview
-----------
**Game Modding Pre-Checks v6.0** is a PowerShell-based diagnostic and configuration script designed for PC modders and developers.  
It scans a Windows system for environment readiness, lists active security features, and can (optionally) disable them to ensure compatibility when running or debugging heavily modified game clients.

The script generates a full timestamped **Security Feature Report** under:
```
C:\TobysFiles\Security_Feature_Report_<timestamp>.txt
```

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
---------------

üîç **System Audit**
- Collects full hardware & OS information (CPU, GPU, BIOS, TPM, Virtualization, RAM, Storage, Motherboard)  
- Displays build number, architecture, and Windows version  
- Logs all findings to file for later reference  

üõ°Ô∏è **Security Check Suite**
Scans and reports the status of:
- **SmartScreen** (Explorer, Edge, Store Apps)  
- **Windows Defender Real-Time Protection**  
- **User Account Control (UAC)**  
- **Windows Firewall Profiles** (Domain, Private, Public)  
- **Exploit Protection Mitigations**  
  - Control Flow Guard (CFG)  
  - Data Execution Prevention (DEP)  
  - ASLR (Force Relocate Images, Bottom-up, High Entropy)  
  - SEHOP and Heap Integrity Validation  

üß© **Optional Disable Module**
After review, users can opt to disable all security features for modding/testing.  
The script safely:
- Edits the registry using hardened functions  
- Updates Defender, Firewall, and UAC settings  
- Disables Exploit Protection system-wide  
- Re-checks and verifies each setting post-change  

üßæ **Comprehensive Logging**
- Every action is timestamped and written to a report  
- Includes error handling and status color-coding for each operation  
- Safe registry functions (`Set-RegValueSafe`, `Ensure-Key`) prevent damage  

üß∞ Usage
--------

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Run Pre-Check Only**
1. Save the script as `GAME MODDING-MASTER-PRECHECKS v6.0.ps1`  
2. Right-click ‚Üí **Run with PowerShell (Admin)**  
3. The script will:  
   - Elevate permissions if needed  
   - Collect and display all system and security information  
   - Generate a log in `C:\TobysFiles`  

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Optional Disable Stage**
After the scan, it asks:
```
You can disable the above security features now. (Some changes require a reboot to fully apply.)
Disable ALL now? (Y/N)
```
If ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, the script automatically adjusts SmartScreen, Defender, Firewall, UAC, and Exploit Protection, then runs a post-check verification.
